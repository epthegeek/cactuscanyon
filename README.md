Cactus Canyon Continued
=======================

A P-ROC Project.  Written by an amateur.  Seriously, this is the first OOP I've ever
done, so my code is probably garbage.  Try not to laugh.

This is built on the shoulders of giants
========================================

A lot of code in this thing is heavily cribbed from the work of others. A LOT. Built
upon the PyProcGame framework by Adam Preble and Gerry Stellenberg,  it includes a lot
of borrowed ideas from the likes of Koen Heltzel, Jim Askey and others.  Without those
guys, there'd be no this thing.  They're awesome. I'm a nub.

I should be clear here, due to the misrepresentation of others as to what this means:
By "heavily cribbed from the work of others" I mean that I studied other available projects
to see how they did things, learned from them, and wrote my own.  I didn't just take
someone's project and bolt my crap onto it.  Without them to learn from, I would be
nowhere, and I appreciate that their works were available to study -- but I did my own
work.

It's not all here
=================

There's other stuff involved.  The DMD graphics and sounds aren't in here.  So, this
won't run as is.

Disclaimer type stuff
=====================

This code is here, freely available to anyone for perusing and studying or whatever -- but
I ask that if you make changes to it for your own use that you DO NOT redistribute it
under the same project name, and make it VERY CLEAR that it was modified from the original,
so that I don't have other people asking me about code I didn't write.

I can't be blamed for anything you do with this code.  If you take it and use it for
something, that's on you. I make no guarantees of any kind as to function or performance.
