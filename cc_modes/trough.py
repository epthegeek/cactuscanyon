## A P-ROC Project by Eric Priepke, Copyright 2012-2013
## Built on the PyProcGame Framework from Adam Preble and Gerry Stellenberg
## Original Cactus Canyon software by Matt Coriale
##
## This is a heavily modified copy of the trough code from pyprocgame - I added a bunch of "print"s to
## Help me understand what it was doing, and re-worked a bunch of it to make it make more sense
## to me - mostly in the 'checking swtiches' section.  And made changes to deal with balls
## bouncing back in to the trough after launch

#from procgame.game import Mode
import ep

class Trough(ep.EP_Mode):
    """Manages trough by providing the following functionality:

         - Keeps track of the number of balls in play
         - Keeps track of the number of balls in the trough
         - Launches one or more balls on request and calls a launch_callback when complete, if one exists.
         - Auto-launches balls while ball save is active (if linked to a ball save object
         - Identifies when balls drain and calls a registered drain_callback, if one exists.
         - Maintains a count of balls locked in playfield lock features (if externally incremented) and adjusts the count of number of balls in play appropriately.  This will help the drain_callback distinguish between a ball ending or simply a multiball ball draining.

     Parameters:

         'game': Parent game object.
         'position_switchnames': List of switchnames for each ball position in the trough.
         'eject_switchname': Name of switch in the ball position the feeds the shooter lane.
         'eject_coilname': Name of coil used to put a ball into the shooter lane.
         'early_save_switchnames': List of switches that will initiate a ball save before the draining ball reaches the trough (ie. Outlanes).
         'shooter_lane_switchname': Name of the switch in the shooter lane.  This is checked before a new ball is ejected.
         'drain_callback': Optional - Name of method to be called when a ball drains (and isn't saved).
